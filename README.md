- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @israelopeters.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a career switcher into software engineering. I completed the Northcoders Java Development Bootcamp in July 2024, and I am extending my knowledge by learning Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform while deepening my Java skills (Spring framework) for backend apps.
- I'm currently building an MVP book app for [Gemspread Publishing](publishing.gemspread.com).

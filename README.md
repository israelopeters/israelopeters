- 👋 Hi, I’m @israelopeters.
- 🌱 I’m a career switcher into software engineering. I completed the Northcoders Java Development Bootcamp in July 2024, and I am extending my knowledge by learning Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform for cross-platform development while deepening my Java skills (Spring framework) for backend apps.
